**JavaKids Lite**
A lightweight early prototype for the JavaKids platform.
JavaKids is an education to work ecosystem designed to help teenagers in developing and conflict affected regions enter the digital economy through structured learning and supervised micro tasks.

**Overview**

JavaKids Lite is a simplified experimental environment where future features of the full JavaKids platform are being tested. The goal is to create a mobile friendly learning and task system that meets young learners where they are and gives them a clear path into tech skills and digital income.

**This version focuses on:**

basic structure testing

early UI logic

simple feature experiments

preparing the foundation for scalable modules

**Vision**

In many regions teenagers start working at sixteen but often enter physically demanding manual jobs with limited access to education or long term digital opportunities. JavaKids aims to offer an alternative by teaching coding and digital skills directly on the phone and then connecting students to supervised micro tasks that match their level and strengths.
These tasks are simple and repeatable which makes them ideal for young learners and useful for companies that need scalable support.
JavaKids creates value for learners, companies and communities by building a skill-to-earnings pipeline.

**Goals of This Lite Version**

test learning flow concepts

validate simplified task assignment logic

explore layout and mobile friendliness

create a safe space for technical experimentation before the full build

**Status**

Active development.
This repository is part of the ongoing prototyping phase while the full platform is being architected.

**Roadmap**

integrate clean modular structure

add more learning components

prepare a basic task simulator

refine UI for low bandwidth devices

prepare integration points for the full platform

Tech Stack (current and planned)

HTML, CSS, JS for prototype logic

other options under review for scaling

planned integration with backend once architecture is finalized

**Contributing**

This prototype is currently being developed by the founder HaneenZM
Contributions will be invited later when the core structure is finalized.
